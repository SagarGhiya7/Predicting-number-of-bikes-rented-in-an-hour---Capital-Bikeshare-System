# Predicting-number-of-bikes-rented-in-an-hour---Capital-Bikeshare-System

Renting a bike is becoming popular day by day leading to increased revenues. People also like the facility of renting a bike from a place and putting it back at another place. So it becomes very important for companies like Capital Bike Share to accurately predict the number of bikes that will be rented to maintain a good balance between supply and demand.


Obtained the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Performed feature selection to implement Machine Learning models and did some basic exploration of data by creating visualizations. Implemented Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression to predicted the number of bikes that will be rented in an hour.


Used Grid Search Cross Validation to tune hyperparameters get best possible accuracies. Reduced Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) by 76.5% from the base model with Random Forests. Plotted variable importances to determine important features for random forests algorithm.
